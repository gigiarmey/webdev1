            <h3>Choose your hamster</h3>
            <p>Did you know that there are over 20 different species of hamster? The most popular species for pets are the golden or Syrian hamster, and three different members of dwarf hamsters: the winter white dwarf hamster, Campbell's dwarf hamster, and the Roborovski hamster, the smallest of all hamster species.</p>

            <h3>Commitment</h3>
            <p> A hamster’s lifespan is a good deal shorter than that of most other common household critters, and any of the five species of domesticated hamster will generally live for two to three years, says Claudie, "The Hamster Whisperer" and proprietor of the Westchester Rescued Hamster Haven. Any hamster that is a year and a half old is considered elderly, she says, and how much your hamster shows his or her age will depend on a number of things, including their individual personality and energy level. Fortunately, there are a few things you can do to help your hamster live a healthy, fulfilling life.</p>

            <h3>Set Up</h3>
            <p>Start by purchasing everything you need for your hamster, like its cage, food, water, bedding and exercise wheel, then bring your hamster home. You’ll want to make the transition as easy as possible as it can be stressful for a hamster to go from a pet store or a shelter or a rescue to your home. While a pet store, shelter or a rescue has loud people and unusual smells, your home has its own unusual noises and smells that your hamster will not be adjusted to.</p>
